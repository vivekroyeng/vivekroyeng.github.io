                    <p>Management was one of the great inventions of the industrial age. It solved two problems: the technical challenge of coordinating work across distance, scale, and delay, and the human challenge of aligning individual effort with organizational goals.</p>
                    <p>The org chart was born in 1855, when Daniel McCallum drew a diagram for the New York and Erie Railroad. The company had grown too large to manage through personal relationships alone. McCallum's chart was meant to restore order, to make visible the invisible structure of a sprawling system.</p>
                    <p>Over the next century, management evolved into a science. Frederick Taylor measured work in seconds. Alfred Sloan built hierarchies that could scale. Peter Drucker defined management as "the practice of converting knowledge into performance." <strong>But every structure reflects the medium it manages, and our medium has changed.</strong></p>
                    <p>The breaking point came before AI. Knowledge work had outgrown industrial logic. Creative work is non-linear, hard to measure, resistant to standardization. Yet we kept applying a management playbook built for predictability. <strong>We've been trying to manage ideas the way we once managed inventory.</strong> The friction we blame on remote work or digital tools is really a decades-long mismatch between the way we work and the way we manage.</p>

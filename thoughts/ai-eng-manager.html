                    <p>"Engineering manager" has always felt like an oxymoron. You're either a great engineer or a great people manager—rarely both. But AI is changing that equation, and it's happening faster than most of us realize.</p>
                    <p>Over the past two decades, tech companies took their top engineers and gave them management responsibilities. The successful ones learned to balance both worlds: they'd roll up their sleeves for PR reviews one moment, then navigate team dynamics the next. They knew when to dive into technical details and when to step back and support someone through a tough situation.</p>
                    <p>But here's what happened: over time, the people management side took over. Annual reviews, 1:1s, and high-level coaching became the default. Many managers became hands-off technically, relying on company jargon and political navigation to survive. The engineering chops that made them effective leaders? Those started gathering dust.</p>
                    <p>AI is flipping the script. Two shifts are reshaping what engineering management actually means:</p>
                    <p>First, AI has become your admin assistant. Performance reviews, regular assessments, and the paperwork that used to eat up hours? AI handles it now. That's time you can redirect toward learning the same technologies your team is wrestling with—the frameworks, the tools, the architectural decisions that actually matter.</p>
                    <p>Second, AI is taking over sprint management. Planning sessions, backlog grooming notes, meeting summaries—all the operational overhead that kept you in meetings instead of code. AI tools are handling the coordination work, freeing you from the administrative treadmill.</p>
                    <p>Here's what remains: the irreplaceable human stuff. Compassion. Sense-making. The ability to help someone connect their passion to the right problems. Listening deeply when someone needs to navigate company politics or figure out their next move. These aren't going anywhere.</p>
                    <p>But now you have a choice. With AI handling the paperwork, you can reinvest that time in technical growth. Learn the systems your team is building. Contribute meaningfully to architecture discussions. Be an authentic technical sounding board instead of someone who talks in management fluff.</p>
                    <p>The best engineering managers I know are doing exactly this. They're using AI to automate the admin work, then showing up as real technical leaders, people who can both write code and create space for their teams to thrive.</p>
                    <p>So here's the question: are you still spending your time the old way, or are you leveraging AI tools to automate the paperwork and become the role model your team actually needs?</p>
                    <p>The opportunity is right in front of us. It's time to reclaim what made engineering management powerful in the first place.</p>
